jQuery.validVal is a plugin designed to simplify form validation.<br />
It is highly customizable, very feature rich and can easily be dropped on any type of HTML-form (even AJAX- and HTML5-forms) with very little effort.

### Features
+ Can be used for validating any kind of HTML-form, with very little effort.
+ Supports five default value-validations: "required", "number", "email", "url" and "pattern".
+ Easily extendable with custom value-validations.
+ Great default "invalid-handler" that can be extended or customized.
+ Can validate multiple input-fields for corresponding values.
+ Enables a group of checkboxes to have at least one checkbox to be "required".
+ Clears the placeholder-value "onFocus", even on password-fields.
+ Automatically select the next input-field when the "maxlength" nth-character is entered.
+ Supplies a workaround for IE's lack of support for the :focus-pseudoclass.
