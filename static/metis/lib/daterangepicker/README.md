# Date Range Picker for Bootstrap

![Improvely.com](http://i.imgur.com/LbAMf3D.png)

This date range picker component for Bootstrap creates a dropdown menu from which a user can
select a range of dates. I created it while building the UI for [Improvely](http://www.improvely.com), 
which needed a way to select date ranges for reports.

If invoked with no options, it will present two calendars to choose a start 
and end date from. Optionally, you can provide a list of date ranges the user can select from instead 
of choosing dates from the calendars. If attached to a text input, the selected dates will be inserted 
into the text box. Otherwise, you can provide a custom callback function to receive the selection.

## Usage

This component relies on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com),
[Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

Separate stylesheets are included for use with Bootstrap 2 or Bootstrap 3.

Basic usage:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="moment.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="daterangepicker.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bootstrap.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="daterangepicker-bs3.css" />

<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('input[name="daterange"]').daterangepicker();
});
</script>
```

The constructor also takes an optional options object and callback function. The function will be called whenever 
the selected date range has been changed by the user, and is passed the start and end dates (moment date objects) as 
parameters.

````
$('input[name="daterange"]').daterangepicker(
  { 
    format: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
    startDate: '2013-01-01',
    endDate: '2013-12-31'
  },
  function(start, end) {
    alert('A date range was chosen: ' + start.format('YYYY-MM-DD') + ' to ' + end.format('YYYY-MM-DD'));
  }
);
````
